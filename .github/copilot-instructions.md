# Copilot Instructions for Loppestars

## Key Agent Guidelines (2025)
- **Use `bun` for all JS/TS package management and scripts.** Never use `npm` or `yarn` commands.
- **Do not generate .md summaries or documentation files after each agent task.** Only update or create documentation when explicitly requested.
- **Commit messages must be short, clear, and include a relevant emoji.** Example: `fix: üêõ handle missing API key in AndroidManifest`
- **The ECS deploy GitHub Actions workflow is fully functional.** It includes Cloudflare DNS check/update and CloudWatch log group creation. No manual post-deploy steps are needed.
- **Each main folder should have a `.vscode/` directory with a `copilot-instructions.md` for folder-specific Copilot guidance.** Always check for and follow these local instructions when working in a subproject.

## Project Overview
This is an app that makes it fun and easy to rate the stalls at your local flea market in a friendly way. Users can browse nearby markets, rate the market and the stalls with photos, and view ratings.
It consists of several central components and services, including a Supabase Cloud instance and a Dockerized API for face pixelation and market data scraping, deployed on AWS ECS. Github Actions is used for CI/CD of the Docker API. Copilot Tnstructions are provided globally as well as on a per-folder basis.

**The mobile app code is located in the `app/` folder.** The app  is a React Native/Expo mobile application. It has Google OAuth authentication and Supabase backend integration.
**The Dockerized FastApi is located in the `api/` folder.** It provides endpoints for face detection and pixelation in images, as well as a Scrapy web scraper for fetching market data from multiple local websites. The API can run locally and is deployed to AWS ECS behind a public loadbalancer using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The DNS for the loadbalancer is hosted in **CloudFlare**. Supabase cron edge function is used to trigger the scraper once a day.
**The Supabase backend is located in the `supabase/` folder.** It contains database migrations and edge functions. The Supabase instance is hosted on Supabase Cloud and must not be run locally. The `api-proxy` edge function is used to interact with the Docker API from the mobile app.
**The AWS infrastructure code is located in the `aws/` folder.** It contains an AWS CDK project that defines the ECS cluster, service, and task definition for deploying the Docker API. The infrastructure is deployed using `cdk deploy` and is hosted in the eu-central-1 region.

- More tab uses nested stack navigation for sub-screens
- AuthWrapper manages authentication state and screen transitions
- AuthGuard HOC protects screens requiring authentication
- Session persistence with AsyncStorage and Supabase session monitoring
- Clean logout functionality that returns to login screen

### Authentication Flow
- Google OAuth via Supabase Auth with native Google and Facebook Sign-In
- Deep linking support for OAuth callbacks
- Platform-specific Supabase URLs (10.0.2.2 for Android emulator, 127.0.0.1 for iOS)
- Auto-refresh tokens and session management
- AsyncStorage for session persistence on mobile platforms
- Automatic permissions request (camera + location) on successful login
- Logo display on auth screen with localized welcome messages

### Camera and Photo Integration

bun run start          # Start Expo development server
bun run web           # Run in web browser
## Development Workflow

### App Development (always use bun)
```bash
cd app/
bun run start          # Start Expo development server
bun run android        # Run on Android emulator
bun run ios            # Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
bun run web            # Run in web browser
bun run ts:check       # TypeScript type checking
bun run ts:watch       # TypeScript watch mode
```

### Supabase Cloud Development
- Cloud-hosted Supabase instance for production and development
- Database schema managed through Supabase dashboard
- Google OAuth configured with client IDs in environment
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/`


### Build Process
- Uses Expo CLI for bundling and native builds (always invoked via bun)
- Android build configuration in `android/app/build.gradle`
- iOS configuration in `ios/` folder
- Environment variables managed via `react-native-config`
- EAS Build for production builds

## Configuration Notes
- Google OAuth client IDs are environment-specific (web and Android)
- Supabase URLs differ by platform for local development
- Environment variables loaded via `react-native-config`
- Platform detection for web vs. mobile storage
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- NativeWind for styling with Tailwind configuration
- Patch-package used for dependency patches
- All environment variables centralized in root `.env` file

## Docker API & CI/CD

### API Structure
The API is located in the `api/` folder and includes:
- `main.py` - FastAPI application with face processing endpoints
- `face_processor.py` - Face detection and blurring logic using OpenCV
- `scraper_cron.py` - Scheduled market data scraping
- `scrapy_project/` - Scrapy spiders for market listings
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` (root level) - Container definition for ECS deployment


### Deployment Pipeline
**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the Docker API (`api/` folder or root `Dockerfile`):
1. **Edit** API files, dependencies, or Dockerfile.
2. **Commit & Push** with a short, clear, emoji commit message to `main` or `kitty`.
3. **Monitor GitHub Actions**:
   - Use `gh run list --limit 1 | cat` to check latest workflow status
   - Use `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log | cat` for logs if failed
   - Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-ecs.yml`
4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Workflow completes successfully (‚úÖ SUCCESS)
   - ECS service runs new task with latest image digest
   - Cloudflare DNS and CloudWatch log group are checked/updated automatically
   - No manual post-deploy steps required

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The automated deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-ecs.yml`):
- **Triggers**: Push to `main` or `kitty` branches
- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Configure AWS credentials
  3. Login to Amazon ECR
  4. Build Docker image with build args (Supabase credentials, bucket names)
  5. Push image to ECR with commit SHA tag
  6. Register new ECS task definition (family: `loppestars`, container: `web`)
  7. Update ECS service with new task definition
  8. Wait for deployment to stabilize
  9. Verify deployment by comparing image digests

### Common CI/CD Issues & Solutions
1. **ECR Immutable Tag Error**: Only use commit SHA tags, never `latest`
2. **Cluster/Service Discovery**: Use first available cluster/service (CDK-generated names)
3. **Container Name Mismatch**: Task definition must use container name `web` (not `loppestars-container`)
4. **Task Definition Format**: Ensure valid JSON with proper quotes, no trailing commas
5. **Environment Variables**: Set as GitHub Secrets (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, AWS credentials)
