# From project root
./scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/start-local-api.sh
./scripts/rebuild-stack.sh
./scripts/trigger-scraper.sh
./scripts/tail-logs.sh
```

## Dependencies

Scripts require:
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
- AWS CLI (for deployment)
- Environment variables in root `.env` file

## Migration Notes

These scripts were moved from various locations to centralize all operational scripts:
- `start-local-api.sh` (from root)
- `deploy.sh` (from aws/)
- `rebuild-stack.sh` (from aws/)

All references in documentation and other files have been updated to point to the new locations.
