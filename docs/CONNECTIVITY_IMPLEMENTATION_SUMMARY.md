# Connectivity Check Implementation - Summary

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive connectivity check system that verifies database and API connectivity on app startup.

## Files Created

1. **`app/utils/connectivityCheck.ts`** - Core connectivity checking logic
   - Tests Supabase database connection (markets table query)
   - Tests FastAPI backend health endpoint
   - Returns detailed status with latency metrics

2. **`app/contexts/ConnectivityContext.tsx`** - React context for connectivity state
   - Performs automatic check on app startup
   - Provides connectivity status to all components
   - Includes `recheckConnectivity()` function for manual retries

3. **`app/components/ConnectivitySplash.tsx`** - Visual feedback UI
   - Shows loading state during checks
   - Displays success with latency metrics
   - Shows error/warning states with detailed information
   - Beautiful UI with icons and proper styling

## Files Modified

1. **`app/components/AuthWrapper.tsx`**
   - Integrated connectivity context
   - Shows connectivity splash before authentication
   - Blocks app if offline with retry button
   - Logs warnings for degraded state

2. **`app/App.tsx`**
   - Added `ConnectivityProvider` wrapper
   - Wraps entire app to provide connectivity state

3. **`.env`**
   - Added `API_BASE_URL=https://loppestars.spoons.dk`

4. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**
   - Updated to document connectivity check feature

## How It Works

### Startup Flow
```
App Launch
    ‚Üì
ConnectivityProvider initializes
    ‚Üì
Parallel checks (database + API)
    ‚Üì
Determine status: healthy/degraded/offline
    ‚Üì
Show appropriate splash screen
    ‚Üì
Continue to app or show retry button
```

### Three Possible States

1. **Healthy** ‚úÖ
   - Both database and API connected
   - Shows brief success screen (1.5s)
   - Continues to app

2. **Degraded** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - One service connected, one failed
   - Shows warning with details
   - Continues to app with limitations

3. **Offline** ‚ùå
   - Both services disconnected
   - Shows error screen with retry button
   - Blocks app until connection restored

### Checks Performed

**Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT id FROM markets LIMIT 1
```
- Tests Supabase connectivity
- Measures latency
- Returns connection status

**API Check:**
```http
GET https://loppestars.spoons.dk/health
```
- Tests ECS FastAPI backend
- Expected response: `{"status": "healthy"}`
- Measures latency

## User Experience

### Success (Healthy State)
1. Logo appears with "Checking connectivity..." spinner
2. Shows "All Systems Operational" with green checkmark
3. Shows latency: "Database: 125ms" / "API: 87ms"
4. After 1.5 seconds ‚Üí proceeds to login/app

### Error (Offline State)
1. Logo appears with spinner
2. Shows "Connection Failed" with red WiFi-off icon
3. Lists failed services with error messages
4. "Retry Connection" button appears
5. User taps retry ‚Üí checks again

### Warning (Degraded State)
1. Logo appears with spinner
2. Shows "Limited Connectivity" with yellow warning icon
3. Lists which services are up/down
4. Proceeds to app (some features may not work)

## Console Output

The system provides detailed console logs:

```
üöÄ Starting connectivity checks...
üîç Checking Supabase database connectivity...
‚úÖ Database connected (125ms)
üîç Checking API connectivity...
üì° API endpoint: https://loppestars.spoons.dk
‚úÖ API connected (87ms)
‚úÖ All systems operational
üìä Connectivity Status: {
  overall: 'healthy',
  database: '‚úÖ 125ms',
  api: '‚úÖ 87ms'
}
```

## Testing

### Test Healthy State
```bash
# Ensure everything is running
curl https://loppestars.spoons.dk/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

# Restart app ‚Üí should see brief success screen
```

### Test Offline State
```bash
# Disable WiFi/airplane mode
# Restart app ‚Üí should see error screen with retry
# Enable WiFi ‚Üí tap "Retry Connection" ‚Üí should proceed
```

### Test Degraded State
```bash
# Block API in hosts file:
# Add to /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 loppestars.spoons.dk
# Restart app ‚Üí should show warning but continue

# Or stop ECS service temporarily
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Clear feedback on connectivity issues
   - No confusing auth or data loading errors
   - User can retry instead of being stuck

2. **Debugging**
   - Detailed console logs
   - Latency metrics for performance monitoring
   - Clear identification of which service is failing

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - App can continue with partial functionality
   - Users informed about limitations

4. **Reliability**
   - Prevents cascade of errors from network issues
   - Verifies services before attempting operations

## API Requirements

Your backend must have a `/health` endpoint:

```python
# In FastAPI (main.py)
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

This already exists in your `api/main.py` file.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Test on device** - Verify connectivity checks work on physical device
2. ‚úÖ **Monitor latency** - Track typical response times
3. üîÑ **Add periodic checks** - Optionally recheck connectivity every 5 minutes
4. üîÑ **Offline mode** - Cache data for offline usage
5. üîÑ **Network state listener** - React to device network changes automatically

## Usage in Code

Access connectivity status anywhere in the app:

```tsx
import { useConnectivity } from '../contexts/ConnectivityContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { status, isChecking, recheckConnectivity } = useConnectivity();
  
  if (isChecking) {
    return <Text>Checking...</Text>;
  }
  
  if (status?.overall === 'offline') {
    return (
      <Button onPress={recheckConnectivity}>
        Retry Connection
      </Button>
    );
  }
  
  return <Text>Connected!</Text>;
}
```
