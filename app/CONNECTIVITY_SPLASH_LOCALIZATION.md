# ConnectivitySplash Localization & Animation Update

## Summary
Updated the ConnectivitySplash screen with full localization support, animated progress bar for connectivity tests, and Lottie animation on success.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Package Installation**
- Installed `lottie-react-native` for Lottie animation support
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve peer dependency conflicts

### 2. **Localization**
All hardcoded strings replaced with `t()` function calls:

**English (en.json)**:
- `connectivity.checkingConnectivity`: "Checking connectivity..."
- `connectivity.verifyingServices`: "Verifying database and API connections"
- `connectivity.testingConnection`: "Testing connection"
- Plus existing keys for status messages

**Danish (da.json)**:
- `connectivity.checkingConnectivity`: "Tjekker forbindelse..."
- `connectivity.verifyingServices`: "Verificerer database og API forbindelser"
- `connectivity.testingConnection`: "Tester forbindelse"
- Plus existing keys for status messages

### 3. **Progress Bar Implementation**
- Animated progress bar shows connectivity check progress
- Smooth animation from 0% â†’ 50% (database check) â†’ 100% (API check)
- Uses React Native `Animated` API for smooth transitions
- Progress bar has orange (#FF9500) fill color matching app branding

### 4. **Lottie Animation**
- Integrated Lottie animation for success state
- Uses `app/assets/lottiefiles/thumbsup.json` file (extracted from dotLottie format)
- Animation plays once when all systems are operational
- Controlled via ref for precise timing
- **Note**: Extracted JSON from `.lottie` file as `lottie-react-native` only supports JSON format

### 5. **UI Improvements**

#### Loading State
- Shows Logo, localized title and subtitle
- Animated progress bar with visual feedback
- Step-by-step indicators for database and API checks
- Clean, minimal design

#### Error State (Offline)
- Red error icon and messaging
- Localized error title and description
- Detailed breakdown of which services failed
- Shows specific error messages per service

#### Warning State (Degraded)
- Yellow warning icon
- Localized warning messages
- Shows status of both services (connected or failed)
- Displays latency for connected services

#### Success State (Healthy)
- **Lottie animation** (120x120) showing thumbs up/success
- Green success messaging
- Shows latency for both services
- Clean, celebratory design

## Code Structure

### Component Features
```typescript
- useTranslation() hook for i18n
- Animated.Value for progress bar animation
- useRef for Lottie animation control
- useEffect for animation lifecycle management
```

### Animation Flow
1. **isChecking === true**: Progress bar animates 0% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%
2. **status.overall === 'healthy'**: Progress completes, Lottie plays
3. **Lottie animation**: Plays once (loop: false, autoPlay: false)

### Styles Added
- `progressBarContainer`: Container for progress bar
- `progressBarFill`: Animated fill for progress bar
- `stepsContainer`: Container for step indicators
- `stepText`: Text style for step descriptions
- `lottieAnimation`: Lottie animation sizing (120x120)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Loading state shows progress bar animation
- [ ] Progress bar animates smoothly through database and API checks
- [ ] All text is localized (no hardcoded English strings)
- [ ] Language switching works (English â†” Danish)
- [ ] Lottie animation plays on success
- [ ] Error state shows correct localized messages
- [ ] Warning state shows mixed status correctly
- [ ] Success state displays latency values

## Files Modified

1. **app/screens/ConnectivitySplash.tsx**
   - Added localization imports and hook
   - Implemented animated progress bar
   - Integrated Lottie animation
   - Replaced all hardcoded strings with t() calls

2. **app/locales/en.json**
   - Added `connectivity.checkingConnectivity`
   - Added `connectivity.verifyingServices`
   - Added `connectivity.testingConnection`

3. **app/locales/da.json**
   - Added `connectivity.checkingConnectivity`
   - Added `connectivity.verifyingServices`
   - Added `connectivity.testingConnection`

4. **app/package.json**
   - Added `lottie-react-native` dependency

## Dependencies

```json
{
  "lottie-react-native": "^6.x.x"
}
```

## Visual Changes

### Before
- Static "Checking connectivity..." text
- Generic spinner (ActivityIndicator)
- Hardcoded English strings
- Simple checkmark icon on success

### After
- Localized "Checking connectivity..." / "Tjekker forbindelse..."
- Animated progress bar with step indicators
- All strings support English and Danish
- **Animated Lottie thumbs up on success** ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

- Progress bar width animates from 0% to 100% using interpolation
- Lottie animation is controlled via ref (not autoPlay)
- Animation only plays when status changes to 'healthy'
- Progress timing: 800ms per phase (database, API)
- Package installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 upgrade

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add sound effects for success state
- [ ] Add haptic feedback on success
- [ ] Retry button for failed connections
- [ ] More granular progress steps (auth, storage, etc.)
- [ ] Custom Lottie animations for error/warning states
